# Define MVP

Early stage AI lab based in San Francisco with a mission to build powerful coding agents, starting with analytics, for junior data analysts, and junior data scientists.

## User Story

As a junior data analyst, I want to be able to retrieve data from a database (web, api, document, internal, etc.) and use it run analytics on it. I want to be able to see the results in a dashboard, and also be able to explain the results to my non-technical stakeholders.
